**Introduction**

On the silent night of April in 1912, the largest ship afloat RMS Titanic aimed towards New York, sank with more than 1500 lives into the depth of the Atlantic Ocean, which was an enormous shock to the whole world. With only 705 survivors on the ship, about 1/3 of the people onboard, we canâ€™t help but ask the questions: Who gets to survive the daunting nightmare of the night? What are the leading factors associating with survival from the sinking of the Titanic? And are these relationships, if any, significant? We explored the demographics on the passengers and then performed statistical tests on our hypotheses and found some interesting conclusions.
